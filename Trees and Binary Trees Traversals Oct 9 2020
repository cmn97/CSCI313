Order Traversal
add head to queue
print head node from queue
add head's children to queue in order
print first child from queue
add first child's child to queue
continue...

Pre order
can use stack.
get first child and go down to leaf node, then continue to second child down to leaf node, etc.
linear time O(n) - master thm only if we divide by the base. but we are not.

Post order
Start at root
post order root; go to first child 2; post order; 
Basically get to the leaf node, then go backwards back up to the root.
Once at the root again, go to the next subtree, then go to the leaf and work backwards.
You want all the leafs first
